# Proma

Proma is a local-first AI desktop app that brings multi-model Chat, general-purpose Agent workflows, workspaces, Skills, MCP, remote bots, and memory into one open-source client.

It is not just another chat box. Proma is meant to become a long-lived Agent workbench for your personal workflows: use Chat for simple answers, use Agent when the task needs to act on files, tools, projects, and longer context.

## What Proma Can Do

- **Chat mode**: multi-model conversations, attachments, image input, Markdown / Mermaid / KaTeX / code highlighting, parallel conversations, system prompts, and context controls.
- **Agent mode**: two built-in runtimes—Claude Agent SDK and Pi Agent SDK—with workspace isolation, permission modes, file operations, streaming output, plan confirmation, and ask-user interactions. Claude is the default; switch runtimes below the Agent input.
- **Collaboration and tasks**: complex work can be split into traceable collaboration agents and tasks, with calls and results shown in the message stream.
- **Skills & MCP**: each workspace can manage its own Skills, MCP servers, and workspace files.
- **Remote bots**: Lark / Feishu bot bridging is supported, with DingTalk and WeChat bridge entry points also present in the app.
- **Memory and tools**: Chat and Agent can share memory, with web search, built-in Chat tools, and Agent recommendation helpers.
- **Local-first data**: conversations, workspaces, attachments, settings, and Skills are stored under `~/.proma/` as JSON / JSONL files, without a local database.
- **Desktop experience**: auto-update, proxy settings, file preview, global shortcuts, quick task window, voice input, and light / dark / system themes.

## Getting Started

### Download

Download the open-source version from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/ErlichLiu/Proma/releases), with builds for macOS Apple Silicon, macOS Intel, and Windows.

If you want fewer API setup steps, you can also use the [Proma commercial version](https://proma.cool/download). The commercial and open-source versions run in parallel; the commercial version mainly adds built-in model channels and subscription options.

### First Setup

1. Open Proma and finish the environment check. Agent mode depends on local tooling, especially Git, Node.js / Bun, and a usable shell.
2. Go to **Settings > Channels**, add at least one AI provider channel, and fill in Base URL, API Key, and model list.
3. Chat mode can use OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, or OpenAI-compatible channels.
4. The default Claude Agent Runtime requires an Anthropic or Anthropic-compatible channel, such as Anthropic, DeepSeek, Kimi API, or Kimi Coding Plan.
5. Enable the channels you want to use from **Settings > Channels > Agent Channels**, then switch Claude / Pi below the Agent input. If you select an OpenAI Chat Completions, Google, or other Pi-only model from a Claude session, Proma automatically switches that session to Pi.
6. Go to **Settings > Agent** and choose the default Agent channel, model, and workspace.
7. Configure memory, web search, or Feishu / DingTalk / WeChat bridges from their corresponding settings tabs if needed.

## Choosing A Mode

### Use Chat For

- Everyday Q&A, explanation, translation, rewriting, and lightweight code discussion.
- Reading attachments and summarizing or comparing their content.
- One-off conversations enhanced by web search or memory tools.
- Comparing outputs from multiple models or exploring different system prompts.

### Use Agent For

- Creating, editing, or organizing local files.
- Research, report writing, and multi-step tasks.
- Work that needs MCP, Skills, Shell, Git, project files, or external context.
- Tasks that benefit from permissions, plan mode, background execution, or remote bot follow-up.

In short: **use Chat when you need an answer; use Agent when you need work to be done.**

## Screenshots

### Chat Analysis

Use Chat for lightweight but practical analysis: compare audience needs, generate a table, and shape first-screen README copy quickly.

### Agent Workbench

Agent works inside a workspace, reads project files, progresses through tasks, outputs structured findings, and keeps reusable files visible in the right-side workspace panel.

![Proma Agent workbench](./docs/assets/screenshots/proma-agent-demo.png)

### Skills

Each workspace can keep its own reusable Skills. The `feedback-synthesis` Skill shown here turns scattered feedback, interviews, and issues into themes, evidence, and priority suggestions.

### Skills & MCP

The same workspace can manage stdio and HTTP MCP servers, enabling or disabling external context per project.

### Streaming Voice Input

Proma supports Doubao-powered streaming voice input, both inside Proma and across the desktop:

- Inside Proma: press Ctrl + Backtick to start recognition, then press it again to finish and insert the transcript into the active Proma input box.
- Outside Proma: press Ctrl + Backtick to start recognition, then press it again to finish and insert the transcript at the current cursor position. If there is no active cursor, Proma writes the transcript to the clipboard.

## Agent Runtimes and Providers

Proma provides two switchable Agent runtimes:

- **Claude Agent Runtime (default)**: powered by `@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk` and using the Anthropic Messages API or compatible endpoints.
- **Pi Agent Runtime**: powered by `@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent`, `pi-agent-core`, and `pi-ai`. It dynamically registers enabled Proma channels as Pi providers and supports OpenAI Chat Completions / Responses, Google Generative AI, Anthropic Messages, and compatible endpoints.

| Channel type | Chat | Claude Agent | Pi Agent |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Anthropic / Anthropic-compatible | Supported | Supported | Supported |
| Anthropic-protocol channels such as DeepSeek, Kimi API / Coding Plan, Zhipu Coding Plan, MiniMax, and Xiaomi MiMo | Supported | Supported | Supported |
| OpenAI, OpenAI Responses, Google, Zhipu AI, Doubao, and Qwen | Supported | Auto-switches to Pi | Supported |
| Custom OpenAI-compatible endpoints | Supported | Auto-switches to Pi | Supported |
| ChatGPT subscription (Codex OAuth) | — | Auto-switches to Pi | Supported |

> Pi Runtime can be switched directly below the input of each Agent session. Switching starts a new underlying SDK session but does not delete Proma's saved messages. Pi bridges workspace Skills, user-configured MCP servers, and Proma's built-in Automation / Collaboration tools. Tool calling, reasoning, and context capabilities still vary by model provider.

> **Kimi Coding Plan users**: Proma is officially whitelisted by Kimi. Using Proma with your Kimi Coding Plan subscription will not trigger any third-party client ban policy.

## Local Data

Proma stores data in local files so it is easy to back up, migrate, and inspect.

```text
~/.proma/
├── channels.json
├── conversations.json
├── conversations/
│   └── {conversation-id}.jsonl
├── agent-sessions.json
├── agent-sessions/
│   └── {session-id}.jsonl
├── agent-workspaces/
│   └── {workspace-slug}/
│       ├── workspace-files/
│       ├── mcp.json
│       └── skills/
├── attachments/
├── user-profile.json
├── settings.json
└── sdk-config/
```

API keys are encrypted through Electron `safeStorage` before being written to `channels.json`. Proma does not use a local database; core data is represented as JSON configuration and append-only JSONL logs.

## Development

Proma is a Bun workspace monorepo.

## Architecture

Proma's core communication path is:

```text
shared types and IPC constants
  -> main/ipc.ts handlers
  -> preload/index.ts window.electronAPI bridge
  -> renderer Jotai atoms and React components
```

Main-process services live in `apps/electron/src/main/lib/`:

- `agent-orchestrator.ts`: Agent orchestration, runtime routing, environment variables, SDK calls, event streams, and error handling.
- `adapters/claude-agent-adapter.ts` / `adapters/pi-agent-adapter.ts`: runtime adapters for Claude and Pi; `runtime-routing-agent-adapter.ts` routes each session to its selected runtime.
- `agent-session-manager.ts`: Agent session index and JSONL message persistence.
- `agent-workspace-manager.ts`: workspaces, MCP, Skills, and workspace files.
- `chat-service.ts`: Chat streaming, Provider Adapters, tool activity.
- `conversation-manager.ts`: Chat session index and message storage.
- `channel-manager.ts`: channel CRUD, API key encryption, connection tests, model fetching.
- `feishu-bridge.ts` / `dingtalk-bridge.ts` / `wechat-bridge.ts`: remote bot bridges.
- `chat-tool-*`, `document-parser.ts`, `workspace-watcher.ts`: tools, document parsing, and file watching.

Renderer state is managed with Jotai. Key atoms live in `apps/electron/src/renderer/atoms/`. Agent IPC listeners are mounted globally at the app root so streaming events, permission requests, and background tasks survive view changes.

## Packaging Notes

Both Agent runtimes run as esbuild external dependencies in the main process. Before invoking `electron-builder`, the Electron packaging scripts run `bun run sync:runtime-deps` to copy these runtime dependency closures into the app directory:

- `@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk` (including the platform-specific Claude native binary)
- `@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent`, `pi-agent-core`, and `pi-ai`
- Pi runtime native modules and `pdfjs-dist`

When changing packaging, verify that:

- `build:main` / `watch:main` keep both Agent SDKs external.
- `scripts/sync-runtime-deps.ts` stays aligned with the external runtime dependency list.
- `electron-builder.yml` retains the `asarUnpack` rules for the Claude binary and Pi native add-ons.
- After `bun run dist:fast` on a target platform, both Claude and Pi (when enabled) can start, call tools, and resume sessions.

See [AGENTS.md](./AGENTS.md) for the full engineering conventions.

## Contributing

Bug fixes, documentation improvements, tests, UX polish, Skills, MCP configs, and real-world Agent workflows are all welcome.

Before opening a PR, please check:

- Use Bun scripts and do not mix npm / pnpm lockfiles.
- Use Jotai for state management.
- Keep the app local-first and prefer config files plus JSON / JSONL storage.
- Do not use TypeScript `any`; prefer `interface` for object shapes.
- When adding IPC, update shared types, main handler, preload bridge, and renderer calls together.
- Bump the patch version of affected packages when behavior changes.
- Add focused tests where possible, especially for shared logic, IPC contracts, and persistence formats.
